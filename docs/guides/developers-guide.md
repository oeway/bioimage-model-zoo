## Models in the BioImage Model Zoo
A BioImage.IO model is a zip file containing all the items, technical description and metadata of the model, together with the trained architecture of the model. Briefly, a BioImage.IO model has at least, the following items:
* Trained model in the correct format (check the Resource Description File Specifications for the [supported formats](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/user_docs/model_descr_latest.md))
* Example input image (numpy array)
* Example output (numpy array)
* Resource description file specifications (`rdf.yaml`)
* An example cover image for visual representation of the model in the zoo.

In some cases, the model may need additional files.

### Model contribution requirements

- Follow the [BioImage.IO Model Resource Description File Specification (RDF)](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/user_docs/model_descr_latest.md). 
- The model is expected to be cross-compatible among the consumer software, and should always run on at least one.
- The model should be well documented (i.e., human readable name and rich description tailored for life-scientists, citations)
- The model should be public and can be used by anyone under the chosen licensing conditions.

### Upload a model to the BioImage Model Zoo

**1. Create a BioImage.IO model** 
Two options:
   1. Choose one way to create your model:
      - Automatic export of the model using the [bioimageio.core python library](https://github.com/bioimage-io/core-bioimage-io-python) (recomended).
        Example code [here](https://github.com/bioimage-io/core-bioimage-io-python/blob/main/example/model_creation.ipynb).
          - The main function to build the model is `bioimageio.core.build_model`. Check its input variables to know what has to be provided.
      - Manual generation of the model:
         - Create the [BioImage.IO Model Resource Description File Specifications](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/user_docs/model_descr_latest.md) (`rdf.yaml` file).
         - Each field on the file is either mandatory or optional. In the Bioimage Model Zoo web page you can find different examples. 
   2. Check that the model is correctly created:
      - Static validation of the model format using the [bioimageio.core python library](https://github.com/bioimage-io/core-bioimage-io-python) library (*e.g.*, in the terminal, `bioimageio validate /../rdf.yaml`).
      - Dynamic validation of the model's deployment (*e.g.*, in the terminal, `bioimageio test-model --weights tensorflow_saved_model_bundle --device cpu /.../rdf.yaml`). It tests that the model generates the expected output.
      
**2. Upload the model to the BioImage Model Zoo**

    1. Visit the [bioimageio](https://bioimage.io) website and click the "Upload" button to access the model upload page.
    2. Log in using your Google or GitHub account.
    3. Upload a resource file, which can be a single zip archive containing all necessary files, or you can select/drag and drop individual files. The 'rdf.yaml' file needed for uploading can be created in the next step.
    4. In the "Review and Edit Your Model" section, provide all necessary metadata to create the 'rdf.yaml' file. Ensure to give a descriptive name and description, and add the maintainer responsible for the upload. See the Model Documentation below for details such as how to name your model.
    5. Once ready, click "Validate" and wait for your model to be reviewed.

All models and resources in the BioImage Model Zoo undergo testing and validation before being accepted for publication. Some modifications may be required to meet the publication specifications after uploading.

###  Model Documentation
#### Model naming

Models are expected to be used by life-scientists, thus, it is expected that the naming is human readable but also informative enough regarding the final application and the biological tissue being analysed. Example:
   
   **Name:** `Neuron Segmentation in EM (Membrane Prediction)`, `B. Sutilist bacteria segmentation - Widefield microscopy - 2D UNet`

   
#### Model Tags
The tags in the model RDF are used to search for each model in the BioImage Model Zoo. The more informative tags you write, the easier it will be for a potential user to find your model. Example:

   **My model description**: An encoder-decoder trained for denoising of point-scanning super-resolution microsocpy images of HeLa cells microtubules
   
   **Tags**: `denoising`, `PSSR`, `microtubules`, `encoder-decoder`, `deblurring`, `fluorescence`, `2D`, `HeLa cells`, `deepimagej`, `ilastik`, `image restoration`, `trained-model` etc.

#### Model links
The BioImage Model Zoo is a software webpage. Each model is displayed with an interactive card that can have datasets, notebooks, applications, consumer-software or test-run buttons linked. Example:
    
   **Links**: `imjoy/BioImageIO-Packager`, `ilastik/ilastik`, `deepimagej/deepimagej`, `zero/dataset_fnet_3d_zerocostdl4mic` etc.

#### Representative Covers

You can include different cover images that represent the analysed tissue, imaging modality, image processing task and the performance of the model. This image will be used in the model card to guide the users through the model search.


### Considerations for the model description file

When following the BioImage.IO model RDF specification provided at https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io, it is important that you pay special attention to the following:
* Choose test input image(s) and generate the respective test output tensor(s). This enables our scripts to test your model for technical correctness and to test which [consumer software](https://bioimage.io/docs/#/guides/user-guide?id=using-bioimage-model-zoo-models-in-different-software) can process it.
* Pre-processing and post-processing should be always described. You can check which [preprocessing](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/user_docs/model_descr_v0-5.md#inputspreprocessing-sequence--) and [postprocessing](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/user_docs/model_descr_v0-5.md#outputspostprocessing-sequence--) functions are supported at the moment and open an [issue here](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/issues) if you are missing a specific operation. 
* Do not forget to include any additional files needed for the correct execution of the model during the upload process.

### Model Resource Description File Specification (0.4.9)
This specification defines the fields used in a BioImage.IO-compliant resource description file (`RDF`) for describing AI models with pretrained weights.
These fields are typically stored in YAML files which we call Model Resource Description Files or `model RDF`.
The model RDFs can be downloaded or uploaded to the bioimage.io website, produced or consumed by BioImage.IO-compatible consumers(e.g. image analysis software or other website).

The model RDF YAML file contains mandatory and optional fields. In the following description, optional fields are indicated by _optional_.
_optional*_ with an asterisk indicates the field is optional depending on the value in another field.

* <a id="format_version"></a>`format_version` _(required String)_ Version of the BioImage.IO Model Resource Description File Specification used.
    This is mandatory, and important for the consumer software to verify before parsing the fields.
    The recommended behavior for the implementation is to keep backward compatibility and throw an error if the model yaml
    is in an unsupported format version. The current format version described here is
    0.4.9

    Keys in `config` may be very specific to a tool or consumer software. To avoid conflicted definitions, it is recommended to wrap configuration into a sub-field named with the specific domain or tool name, for example:
    
    ```yaml
       config:
          bioimage_io:  # here is the domain name
            my_custom_key: 3837283
            another_key:
               nested: value
          imagej:
            macro_dir: /path/to/macro/file
    ```
    If possible, please use [`snake_case`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) for keys in `config`.
    For example:
    ```yaml
    config:
      # custom config for DeepImageJ, see https://github.com/bioimage-io/configuration/issues/23

    * <a id="run_mode:kwargs"></a>`kwargs` _(optional Kwargs→Dict\[String, Any\])_ Key word arguments.
* <a id="sample_inputs"></a>`sample_inputs` _(optional List\[Union\[URI→String | Path→String\]\])_ List of URIs/local relative paths to sample inputs to illustrate possible inputs for the model, for example stored as png or tif images. The model is not tested with these sample files that serve to inform a human user about an example use case.
* <a id="sample_outputs"></a>`sample_outputs` _(optional List\[Union\[URI→String | Path→String\]\])_ List of URIs/local relative paths to sample outputs corresponding to the `sample_inputs`.
* <a id="tags"></a>`tags` _(optional List\[String\])_ A list of tags.
* <a id="training_data"></a>`training_data` _(optional Union\[Dataset | LinkedDataset\])_ 
    1.  _(optional Dataset)_ in-place definition of [dataset RDF](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/user_docs/dataset_descr_v0-3.md)
    1.  _(optional LinkedDataset)_   is a Dict with the following keys:
        * <a id="training_data:id"></a>`id` _(optional String)_ dataset id
* <a id="version"></a>`version` _(optional Version→String)_ The version number of the model. The version number format must be a string in `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format following the guidelines in Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 (see https://semver.org/), e.g. the initial version number should be `0.1.0`.


## Other contributions
You are welcome to submit your **models**, **datasest**, **applicaitons** and Jupyter **notebooks** to BioImage.IO.

To add an resource item to BioImage.IO, you need to provide a set of basic information about the resouce, including name, description, authors etc. and we will generate a resource card to display in the website.

For Community Partners, you can add models directly to the linked repository. If you are not part of the community partners, you can follow the instructions below to submit resource items (models, datasets etc.) to BioImage.IO.

### Submit to BioImage.IO
* Step 1, prepare a [`Resource Description File`](/bioimageio_rdf_spec)(RDF) and complete at least the mandatory fields and ideally also the recommended fields for different types of resource.

* Step 2, save the RDF file in one of the public git hosting website, it is recommended to store the RDF file in your project git repository on Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket (make sure it's a public repo). Alternatively, you can post it on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/), copy the the **raw** url to the actual file content.

* Step 3, post the url to the comment box below (if you don't see it, click [here](https://github.com/bioimage-io/bioimage-io-models/issues/26)). And the admin team will check and verify the format and incooperate to BioImage.IO if the submitted file is qualified.
