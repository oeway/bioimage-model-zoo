# Join as a community partner

BioImage.IO is community driven, and the models and other resources are contributed by the community members. To help us better maintain the resources, we introduced the concepts of community partner. A community partner is an organization, a company, a research group, or a software team who would like to make continuous contributions to BioImage.IO. A typical case for a community partner is a consumer software of BioImage.IO (e.g. ilastik, Fiji).

## How does it work
Community partners can host their own Github repository for storing models and other resources that are relevant. These resources are listed in a [collection RDF](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/collection_spec_latest.md)–a yaml file–which will be dynamically linked to the [central repository of BioImage.IO](https://github.com/bioimage-io/bioimage-io-models). The [continuous integration (CI) service](https://github.com/bioimage-io/bioimage-io-models/actions) configured in the central repo will then pull the resources from partners' repo and compile them into items displayed in the BioImage.IO website. Each community partner is responsible for maintaining the resources that are relevant. For example, ilastik, as a community partner, is responsible for maintaining
