# BioImage Model Zoo: Advanced AI models in one-click

The Bioimage Model Zoo is a community-driven AI model repository. The aim is to facilitate the adoption of AI methods among the bioimaging community by providing easy access to pretrained AI models. By establishing a common model description file format, the model zoo serves as a distribution point for deep learning models trained to perform bioimage analysis tasks.

Several founding partners including ilastik, ImJoy, Fiji, DeepImageJ and ZeroCostDL4Mic are involved in the creation of the model zool and we welcome more community partners to join the efforts. Our vision is to define a common standard which would allow all models in the model zoo to be compatible with community partner tools. Such compatibility will ensure that the models in the model zoo can be interoperable between different tools and truly be used by non-computational biologists through user-friendly interface. 

In addition to the model description file format, we aim to make cutting-edge AI technology accessible to our users by providing detailed model descriptions, tagging, searching and automatic testing of all submitted models. Models can be directly executed from the site with users' own data samples, and linked to its training data and Jupyter/Colab Notebooks.

The model zoo is open for contributions from the community partners and external individuals. You are welcome to submit models to the model zoo. We will do our best to ensure you have a smooth experience contributing your work which will of course remain in your IP with all necessary attributions.
