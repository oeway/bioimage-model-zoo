# Resources for developers

## Python resources
### [Python BioImageIO core package](https://github.com/bioimage-io/core-bioimage-io-python)

The `bioimageio.core` is the main package to interact with the BioImageIO contents (*e.g.*, models, datasets, applications). It contains utilities to load and use BioimageIO resources such as processing images with BioImageIO models.

Detailed documentation  on the package can be found on [GitHub](https://bioimage-io.github.io/core-bioimage-io-python/bioimageio/core.html), along with [example notebooks](https://github.com/bioimage-io/core-bioimage-io-python/tree/main/example).

### [Python BioImageIO spec package](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io)

The `bioimageio.spec` package enables the interaction with the BioImageIO Resource Description File (RDF) specifications for models, datasets, applications, and notebooks. It is a dependency of the [`bioimageio.core`](https://bioimage-io.github.io/core-bioimage-io-python/bioimageio/core.html). This package contains the utilities for model metadata information handling.

Detailed documentation on the package can be found on [GitHub](https://bioimage-io.github.io/spec-bioimage-io/bioimageio/spec.html), along with [example notebooks](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/tree/main/example_use).

## Java resources
### [Java BioImageIO library](https://github.com/bioimage-io/JDLL)

Detailed instructions on how to use the Java Deep Learning library can be found in the [Wiki guide](https://github.com/bioimage-io/JDLL/wiki/0.-Home), which also includes a [Quickstart](https://github.com/bioimage-io/JDLL/wiki/II.-Quickstart-for-developers) guide for developers.
