# FAQs

Have questions about how to participate, contribute, or engage with the BioImage Model Zoo? Check out our Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) for detailed answers and insights into making the most of your experience with our project.

### How can I participate in the BioImage Model Zoo?

To participate, you can take on the role of a **Community Partner** or engage as a **Consumer** or **Contributor** of models from the BioImage Model Zoo.

- **Consumer**: As a Consumer, your role involves utilizing the existing models available on bioimage.io by downloading and incorporating them into your workflow using connected software or in any specific manner. For instance, a Life Scientist can be a Consumer by using a Deep Learning model downloaded from bioimage.io and integrating it into any compatible software (deepImageJ, Ilastik, ImJoy, ZeroCostDL4Mic, ...).

- **Contributor**: If your primary objective is to contribute models to bioimage.io, then you are a Contributor. As such, you play a crucial role in expanding the range of available models and supporting the bioimage analysis community.

### What is a Community Partner? Who can be a Community Partner?

Usually, a **Community Partner** is an organization, a company, a research group, or a software team (of one or more) that can consume and/or produce models from/for the BioImage.IO Model Zoo.

The first community partners represent open source consumer software of BioImage.IO (e.g. ilastik, Fiji, deepImageJ, ZeroCostDL4Mic, StarDist).

A Community Partner can either be a team behind a software which produces or consumes trained models compatible with the BioImage.IO specifications or an organization, group, company, or team (of one or more) who contributes models to BioImage.IO.


### How can I upload a model to the BioImage Model Zoo?

To contribute a model to the BioImage Model Zoo, please refer to the [Contribute Models section](https://bioimage.io/docs/#/contribute_models/README). This section provides detailed instructions on how to upload a model, including the necessary steps and required files for your contribution.

### How can I report issues or provide feedback regarding models on BioImage.IO?

If you encounter a bug or wish to share feedback, please use our [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/bioimage-io/bioimage.io/issues). We appreciate your input and kindly request that you ensure your feedback is not duplicated. Your contributions help improve the BioImage Model Zoo for the entire community.

### What is AI4Life?

AI4Life is a project whose goal is to provide sustainable, intuitive, and highest quality research services and infrastructures that will enable all life scientists to exploit machine learning to improve the utility and interpretability of image data, the key to future biomedical research.

### How is AI4Life related to the BioImage Model Zoo?

AI4Life is a project closely aligned with the BioImage Model Zoo. It plays a significant role in supporting and enhancing the BioImage Model Zoo's mission and initiatives.

### Can I use models from the BioImage Model Zoo for commercial purposes?
Yes, you are welcome to use the models from the BioImage Model Zoo for commercial purposes. However, we kindly request that you provide appropriate credits when using these models as a gesture of acknowledgment for the contributions of the model creators and the BioImage Model Zoo community.
